## Are you confused which doc to consult or are you in a country where there are very less doctors?
According to World Health Organization statistics report of 2015, There is about one doctor for 480 patients in Canada. And the patient-to-doc ratio around the globe varies significantly. This ratio experiences massive shifts from 1:150 in well-developed Western countries to a very unbalanced ratio of 1:50,000 economically poor African countries. In South Asian countries like India, this ratio is about 1:1458 which is a bit low when compared to WHO's recommended 1:1000. Every year in India about 50,000 doctors are created for a population of 1.3 billion. A plausible, obvious and most effective solution to this problem is to improve medical infrastructure by opening hospitals and medical colleges which will generate numerous physicians or doctors. But the problem with this is it requires time, effort, and money: simply speaking it's not easy to achieve this. On top of that with the boom in the population proves to be a major challenge to this solution. Hence, for this to cope up and balance the patient-to-doc ratio will take a lot of time and leaving people's health at risk. 

The WHO's statistics report which is generalized and even though it doesn't specify the various number of specialists for a population, it's quite evident that the number of specialized doctors would be even less and hence patients who require dedicated care would have to wait weeks or probably months even in developed Western countries like Canada to get their treatment. This delay in treatment might cause patient's condition to worsen till they meet with a specialist, had they consulted specialist earlier developed complications could have been avoided. Moreover, During COVID-19 many of us might have faced this continued problem as more and more people require healthcare attention with limited facilities available for help. 

In addition to that, often many of us get confused which doctor to consult with while facing a specific problem. As the standard procedure implies you to first meet with a General Physician or a Family doctor before you are referred to a specialist for further treatment. This process is quite time consuming and isn’t productive from a treatments point of view. To disrupt this flow by speeding up the treatment process and reducing cost from health institutions point of view the very focused branch of machine learning that is Natural Language Processing (NLP) can be employed as in effective, efficient and quick solution. Using the data from EHRs we can predict (by utilizing text categorization) in advance based on patients data and current symptoms which doctor they’re supposed to be consulting with directly without the need for them to go through a general physician or GP to get to a specialist. 

# Textual Categorization for Medical Application
Download and install Anaconda IDE and install Spyder IDE with it.

## Steps to install the packages (make sure you've about 30 GB of space to install the packages)
```
conda activate --stack myenv
conda info --envs
conda env list
conda install -n myenv pip
conda activate myenv
conda install --file requirements.txt
```
After the packages are installed then the code can be run.
If any package is missing or is not installed properly re-install by using conda install <package name> or using pip install <package>

Alternatively the code can also be run on Google Colab.

Have you experienced getting delayed Doctors appointment to get treated? Or had to go through a GP who later refers you to a specialized doc? Confused to which doc to consult?
	Probably weeks later, haven’t you?
Solution: Text categorization of medical health records using NLP to predict which doctor to consult with.
